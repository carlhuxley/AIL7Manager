Of course. Based on the detailed information you've provided in ai_apprenticeship.system_spec.md, I have translated your thoughts and requirements into a structured and actionable Project Specification Document.

This document organizes your vision into a formal plan, including a data model and user stories for the MVP, to guide your development process.

Project Specification: The Apprentice Hub
1. Executive Summary

The Apprentice Hub is a personalized, centralized platform designed to streamline the management of a Level 7 AI Apprenticeship. The primary goal is to solve the fragmentation of learning resources and administrative tasks by unifying evidence collection, progress tracking against Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSBs), and deadline management into a single, cohesive system.

The initial version (MVP) will focus on importing KSB definitions, creating text-based evidence, and linking that evidence to the relevant KSBs, providing a clear visual indicator of curriculum coverage. The long-term vision is to evolve this into a comprehensive lifelong learning portfolio.

2. Core Objectives & Success Metrics

Centralize Learning: Consolidate evidence, project notes, and reflective journals, eliminating the need to navigate multiple disparate systems (BUD, email, LMS, etc.).

Track KSB Progress: Visually map all submitted evidence to the required KSBs, providing an at-a-glance overview of progress and identifying gaps.

Streamline Assessment Preparation: Create a searchable repository of evidence, allowing the user to instantly pull up relevant examples and reflections for any given KSB during the final assessment.

Monitor Off-The-Job Hours: Automatically track and calculate logged learning hours to ensure the 20% target is being met.

Success Metric (MVP): The system successfully stores all KSBs and allows text-based evidence to be created and tagged against them. The user can see a list of KSBs and the corresponding count of linked evidence.

3. User Personas & Roles

Primary Persona: The Apprentice (You)

Goal: To efficiently manage apprenticeship requirements, reduce administrative overhead, and be fully prepared for the final assessment.

Jobs-to-be-Done:

Import and manage KSB definitions.

Upload and categorize evidence (reflections, notes, links).

Link evidence to projects and KSBs.

Log off-the-job training hours.

View progress dashboards.

Secondary (Future) Personas:

Mentor/Manager: To view progress and provide feedback.

Tutor/Assessor: To review submitted portfolios and evidence.

Administrator: To manage system-wide settings and user accounts.

4. Functional Requirements
Module A: Curriculum & KSB Management

A-1: The system must allow for the bulk import of KSBs from a directory of markdown files.

A-2: Each KSB entry in the database shall store its identifier (e.g., "K1", "S5") and its full description text.

A-3: The system shall display a list of all imported KSBs, which can be searched or filtered.

Module B: Evidence & Portfolio Management

B-1: The user must be able to create, read, update, and delete evidence entries.

B-2: An evidence entry shall initially support written text/markdown content.

B-3 (Future): Evidence types will be expanded to include file uploads (documents, images), links (Git commits/PRs, videos), and code snippets.

B-4: A single piece of evidence can be mapped to one or more KSBs (a many-to-many relationship).

Module C: Project & Task Management

C-1: The user can create projects with a Name, Description, Start/End Dates, and Status (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Completed).

C-2: A piece of evidence can be associated with a project.

C-3 (Future): Projects can contain a checklist of tasks.

C-4 (Future): Integrate with external task management tools like Trello via API.

Module D: Logging & Reflection

D-1: The user can log learning hours with a date, duration (in hours/minutes), and a description of the activity.

D-2: A log entry can be linked to a specific piece of evidence.

D-3: The system shall automatically sum all logged hours and display the total against the 20% target.

Module E: Dashboards & Reporting

E-1: The main dashboard will display a list of all KSBs and a numerical count of the evidence linked to each.

E-2: The dashboard will display key upcoming deadlines (manual entry for now).

E-3 (Future): Develop advanced visualizations:

KSB Heatmap: A grid showing coverage and "strength" of evidence for each KSB.

Timeline/Gantt Chart: Visualizing project timelines.

Burndown Chart: Tracking progress of off-the-job hours.

5. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: Initial UI response times can have a slight delay (<2s). Performance is not a primary driver for the MVP.

Security: Authentication will be handled via OAuth providers (Google, GitLab) to ensure secure login without managing passwords.

Usability: The initial UI will be built with a standard framework like Bootstrap for a clean, functional, and responsive interface.

Data Management: Data will be stored in a combination of PostgreSQL (for relational data like users, projects, KSBs) and MongoDB (for flexible document-based evidence). A backup strategy will need to be developed post-MVP.

6. Proposed Technical Architecture

Frontend: Single Page Application (SPA) built with React (using TypeScript).

Backend: RESTful API built with Python (FastAPI).

Databases:

PostgreSQL: For structured, relational data (Users, KSBs, Projects, Logs).

MongoDB: For semi-structured evidence documents.

Deployment: Initial deployment on a DigitalOcean VM.

Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with Google and/or GitLab.

Integrations (Future): GitHub API (for commits/PRs), Google Calendar API (for deadlines), LLM APIs (Gemini for evidence analysis/search).

7. Data Model (Initial Draft)

Here is a basic data model to get you started.

users (Postgres)

id (PK)

email (UNIQUE)

name

oauth_provider

created_at

ksbs (Postgres)

id (PK)

code (e.g., "K1", "S3", UNIQUE)

description (TEXT)

projects (Postgres)

id (PK)

user_id (FK to users)

name

description

start_date, end_date

status

evidence (MongoDB - A flexible document store is great here)

_id (PK)

user_id (Indexed)

project_id (Optional, Indexed)

title

content_type ('markdown', 'link', 'file')

content (The actual text, URL, or file reference)

created_at

8. MVP Scope & User Stories

The MVP is tightly focused on establishing the core data relationships and providing immediate value by tracking KSB coverage.

MVP Features:

User Authentication via Google/GitLab.

A script or simple interface to import KSBs from markdown files.

A form to create and save text-based evidence.

Ability to tag a piece of evidence with one or more KSBs.

A dashboard page that lists all KSBs and shows a count of linked evidence for each.

MVP User Stories:

Story 1 (KSB Import): As an apprentice, I want to run a script to import all my KSB markdown files into the database, so that the curriculum is set up without manual data entry.

Story 2 (Authentication): As an apprentice, I want to log in to the application using my Google account, so that I don't have to create or remember a new password.

Story 3 (Create Evidence): As an apprentice, I want to create a new reflective journal entry using a simple text editor, so that I can document my learning and experiences.

Story 4 (Tag Evidence): As an apprentice, while creating or editing an evidence entry, I want to select one or more KSBs from a list, so that I can link my reflection directly to the curriculum requirements.

Story 5 (View Progress): As an apprentice, I want to view a dashboard that lists every KSB and shows me how many pieces of evidence I have linked to each one, so that I can quickly see my progress and identify gaps in my portfolio.

9. Next Steps & Future Enhancements

Immediate Next Steps:

Set up the development environment (React, FastAPI).

Implement the database schemas based on the data model above.

Begin development on the MVP user stories, starting with authentication and KSB import.

Post-MVP Enhancements (in rough priority order):

Implement Project and Learning Log modules.

Expand evidence types to include links and file uploads.

Develop the Off-The-Job hours calculator and display.

Build advanced dashboard visualizations (Heatmap, Gantt chart).

Integrate with external APIs (GitHub, Google Calendar).

Explore LLM integration for "smart search" of evidence.

Implement secondary user roles (Mentor, Tutor).
